### SVG vs Bitmaps


:black_large_square: **Bitmaps**

##### Advantages

    - Is a good method of reproducing 'continuous tone' images, such as photographs.


##### Disadvantages

    - In terms of the amount of digital storage, bitmaps are memory intensive, and the higher the resolution, the larger the file size.

    - When an image is enlarged, the individual coloured squares become visible and the illusion of a smooth image is lost to the viewer.



:black_large_square: **Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG)**

##### Advantages

    - Small file size and the ability to scale the image to any size without loss of quality; see the image above.


##### Disadvantages

    - Vector graphics, cannot reproduce 'continuous tone' photographic images like bitmaps.


#### Conclusion

    - SVG are perfect to logos, save space and scale images to any size. 
    
    - Bitmaps are ideal to photographs images.
